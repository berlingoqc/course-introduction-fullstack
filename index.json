Being a PC gamer i know some things be name being confront with things from time to time.\nThe ending point would be to be knowledgeable of modern front-end development with understanding of the cloud and how to work in this modern virtual space with good understanding of deeper concept of programmation to really open all the gate for is future independent work afterward. Because the main goal should always be independant. I think of a teacher of computer science as a starter on a motor , all i need is to start the beast and unleash it.\nSo the topic for this classe must be:\n Introduction to programmation  How do we write code from source code to executable. ( PC architecture , assembly , compiler , linker and shared library ) What are the paradigm of programming. (oop , structural , functional ) The different flavor of language. (interpreted vs compiled vs both together) Start the base of programming (condition , loop and variable type ) Object Orientated how do me organize code in 1995 (Class , interface , inheritance , polymorphism ) Functional Programming how do we not bore ourself with abstraction and classe ( first order function , mixin ) I don\u0026rsquo;t want to do things all be myself welcome to Framework and Library with the help of packet manager Doctor i need a editor to help my migrain from writing code in a basic text editor First little project an application that but all of this together Scripting is fun , i can do things other that manually :0   The cloud  What , Where and Who is the damn cloud. How do i get my code there (DNS , webserver and Paas) I\u0026rsquo;m lazy can you plz build , test and deploy this for me CI/CD We gona need a bigger ship to learn Docker How do we scale this ? kubernetes is hard or is it ?   Web programming  I just put things inside \u0026lt;\u0026gt; and i design an interface. Things getting pretty with the help of css But how do we move things , thanks go javascript is a sound language But how do we shared dynamic information help me database Time to choice a development stack for a fullstack application Get your end dirty it\u0026rsquo;s time to code mofo    The language use in this class:\n bash  for scripting and for being apart from normal languge\n python  for scripting in a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; language and for dynamic typing\n go  to learn the base of programming , compilation , library and learning from the doc\n Typescript or javascript front-end  depending of the choice of the student in framework for the final project\n Typescript or go or kotlin  depending of the choice of the student in framework for the final project\n"},{"uri":"https://berlingoqc.github.io/course-introduction-fullstack/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://berlingoqc.github.io/course-introduction-fullstack/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
