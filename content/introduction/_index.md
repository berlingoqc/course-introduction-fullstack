# Introduction to programming

The first part of the class will be about the base of programmation.

## We will answer the following question:

* What is code
* How do we write a program
* The different type of programming language
* The different paradigm of programming language
* What are the tool that we can use to write those program


For you information , this course will not rewrite all there is to know about programming
i will often provide website to already existing website with the information that the student
need to learn on it's own.


## Requirement before starting

This class will be write for UNIX system (MacOS and Linux) if you are using windows i recommand the
following options:

* Use WSL2
* Use a Virtual Machine
* Get the fuck out of windows your a developer now

Linux is not so user friendly and i think the best OS to start programming is MacOS, it has all the
advantage that you have with linux being a unix system and it's fairly easy to use with very good
support all across the board.
