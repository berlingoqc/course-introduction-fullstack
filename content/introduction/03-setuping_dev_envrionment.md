Now it's time to work, we are gonna setup you with a development environment.

A development environment contains the following component normally:

* A text editor
* A compiler or interpreter for your language
* Tooling to help you

In a further chapiter we will talk about IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that 
bundle all of this together but for your own good we will learn to make our own IDE with
great individual software, this will gave you more flexibility and understanding in the
long run. IDE are really usefull but me personnally i only use them when i have special
need (lazyness).
